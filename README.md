# Twitter-of-Russian-opposition
Text analysis of a Russian opposition's rhetoric in Twitter in 2022 and how it has changed after 24.02
Data has been collected through a Python's instrument box and connection to Twitter API. Part of preprocessing, cleaning, division into corpora and preparation for lemmatization are presented in R. Due to specificity of a Russian language, the only more or less appropriate way to lemmatize words is applying 'pymorphy2' library, so Python has been used again. Finally, the main part of analysis is provided in R: word-clouds, LDA, frequency analysis with an appliance of a log-likelihood, sentiment analysis. Partly, results are presented in the following publication (in Russian): https://actualcomment.ru/smena-diskursa-radikalnoy-oppozitsii--2206201127.html
